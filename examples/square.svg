<!-- 
Square (or rect) starts with the location of the upper left point described by its location on the x-axis and y-axis. Here since the width of the entire logo space is 300px, but the height is only 200px, the upper left point of the square will start at 50px in from the upper left corner in order to be centered in the logo space.
